These applications are designed to be used with the volumetric display javascript API. To use either in the browser, download them, and then visit [the web display.](http://rit-sse.github.io/Voxel-Display/) Then, click browse, select the downloaded file, and adjust your camera as you see fit.

#outter.js
Sets the display to display its edge voxels.

#Hexis.js
Starts a game that has similarity to tetris. You stack pieces on the bottom of an 8x8x8 grid, attempting to fill each 8x8 plane. When a plane is perfectly filled, it disappears, and other planes are shifted back to make more room.

Additional Controls: 
  * W/A/S/D - Position piece
  * Q - Rotate left
  * E - Rotate right
  * Space - Drop piece to bottom

You may have to adjust your camera to get a good view of the game. (And possibly adjust during play, too.)
